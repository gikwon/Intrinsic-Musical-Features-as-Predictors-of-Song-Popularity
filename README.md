# Intrinsic-Musical-Features-as-Predictors-of-Song-Popularity

Our project is focused on analyzing musical factors that contribute to the popularity of various music on Spotify. In order to do this, we found datasets that contain song characteristics such as danceability, loudness, etc., which we compared to the popularity and playlist selection of each song. We began by combining our datasets and then extracting only the columns we were interested in. After the data was normalized, we performed an EDA to determine the correlation between specific genres and their music features, which then is used to relate to their overall popularity. Finally, we leveraged stepwise regression and linear regression to analyze the split data to look for predictive factors that indicate a genre's popularity.
